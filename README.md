# React Card Generator

Welcome to the **React Card Generator** project! This is a simple React application that allows users to create and display cards dynamically.

## Description

This project was created as part of my journey in learning **React**. The application demonstrates the basic principles of React, such as:

- **State Management**: Keeping track of user inputs to create unique cards.
- **Component Structure**: Dividing the UI into reusable components.
- **Event Handling**: Interacting with the UI to add data to the cards.

In this project, I used React to create cards with customizable content, including a title, description, and an image. Each card can be dynamically generated with input fields, making it easy to add new cards as needed.

## Features

- **Create Cards**: Input fields to add a title, description, and image URL.
- **Display Cards**: The cards are displayed in a grid format once created.
- **Responsive Layout**: The design is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind_Css**: For styling of the application.
